    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>This short project is aimed at providing a user with an easy path to adjusting the background color.</p>
    <p>The available options are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Red", "Green" and "Blue" buttons.</strong> After clicking on any of the three buttons, the background of the page should change to the corresponding color.</li>
        <li><strong>"Red", "Green" and "Blue" sliders (control elements)</strong> each of which is responsible for controlling one color proportion of the RGB color model. Every time a user moves a controller, the background of the page should change accordingly. The three controllers each regulate the proportion of their respective color and thus determine the background color of the page.</li>
    </ul>
